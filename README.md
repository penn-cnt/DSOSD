# Dynamic Seizure Onset and Spread Detection
Package for implementing a seizure state transition model to detect seizure onset and spread channels in a research and clinical setting. The tools presented in the package can also be deployed on ambulatory data, leveraging the distribution-based unsupervised classification methods implemented in this package.

The package curently only supports a Neural Dynamic Divergence (NDD) model for seizure detection, however additional univariate and DL-enabled models will be available in the next udpate.
